# cx_amplicon
Culex species identification, cqm1 analysis, and blood meal identification with bwa mem assembly of illumina reads from amplicon resequencing (COI, Ace2, cqm1)

## A place to keep track of amplicon reference assembly bioinformatics steps

## To unzip a .tar file (Norah completed 11/8/2024):
```
cd /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/cx_ddRAD_raw
tar -xvf Culex_ddRAD.tar 
mv ./Culex2/Culex2.fastq.gz cx_ddRAD_plate2.fastq.gz
```

## To unzip a .tar.gz file:
```
tar â€“xvzf cx_ddRAD_plate2.tar.gz
mv ./data/Saarman/ddRAD/ddRAD.fastq.gz ./cx_ddRAD_plate2.fastq.gz
```

## Change permissions

# Reference files 

Ref files are saved as _REF.fasta
The final file we plan to use for cqm1 and ace2 workflow is:  
culex_cqm1_ace2_REF.fasta

# Pipeline steps 
 
1. fastqc: Read quality (step 2 in ddRAD)
2. multiqc: Summarize quality results (step 3 in ddRAD)
4. bwa index: build bwa index for reference fasta files (step 4b in ddRAD)
5. bwa mem: assemble to reference file with .pl and .slurm commands (step 5 in ddRAD) 
     - samclip: alignment-aware trimming, specifically designed to remove unwanted sequences like primers or adapters from aligned reads (step not in ddRAD)
     - samtools sort: get ready for variant calling
6. bwa flagstat: summarize assembly results (step 6 in ddRAD)
     - sambamba: per base coverage/depth statistics  (optional extra information)
     - samtools idxstats aligned.bam  # summary of how many reads aligned to each genus (optional extra information)
     - samtools view -b -q 30 aligned.bam > high_confidence_alignments.bam # filter out low-confidence mappings (optional extra information)
7. freebayes: haplotype-aware variant calling (phasing included, step not in ddRAD)
8. vcftools: filtering snps and haplotypes, or diverge entirely to analyze haplotypes (optional extra information)
